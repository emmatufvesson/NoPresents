# NoPresents 

## My first attempt to modify my cat flap installation to keep my cat from bringing home presents.
Presents = mice, birds, grasshoppers, spiders, dragonflies etc

## General idea
Since I already have a sure flap XL installed, I'm going to try to modify it by adding a "robot arm" on the inside to keep my cat from entering with prey in her mouth. 

## Project specifications:
* Sure flap XL, cat flap with chip reader
* Raspberry 5 running Raspberry OS 64 bit
* Google Coral USB accelerator
* 8MP Freenove camera compatible with raspberry 5
* 25KG Servo motor
* Jumper cables
* Breadbord


## Project overview
1. Make sure you have a clean and updated installation of Rasberry OS
2. Connect the camera module to one of the CSI ports on your raspberry
3. Connect Google Coral to one of the USB 3.0 ports on your raspberry
4. Connect the servo motor via breadbord and jumper cables to your raspberry
5. Install dependencies
